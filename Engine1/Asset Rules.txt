Skeleton --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- When modelling skeleton in 3ds Max:
	* To save rigged mesh:
		1) select all geometry and bones
		2) export using OpenCollada exporter (not a default .dae exporter)
	* To save animation: 
		1) select all bones which are part of the animation (and are were exported in the mesh). Do not select anything else (meshes etc.).
		2) top menu/Animation/Save Animation
		3) use .xaf format 
	* Avoid spaces in bone names. Some exporters/importers assume no spaces in names, which can cause errors.
	  Code supports arbitrary names for bones.
	* Each bones must have unique name.
	* If an exception is thrown when loading animation file that a bone doesn't exist in the mesh - exclude that bone from the saved animation in 3ds max.
	* If animated mesh is deformed when animated (very thin or very fat) this could be caused by not having all of the mesh's bones in your final pose. 
	  It's because some of the bones (even those which do not directly affect any vertices) may contain scaling which affects all children bones.
