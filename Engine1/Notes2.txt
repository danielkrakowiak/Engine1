Difficulties during development:
- How to pass VertexBuffer to the compute shader. Can't pass VB normally, because it can't have Shader Resource View.
  Answer: use raw buffers and calculate address in the shader.

- How to implement texturing in raytracing? If GPU decides in the shader which object should be tested for intersection then 
  there is no way to bind needed textures ahead, because we don't know which object will be tested for intersection.
