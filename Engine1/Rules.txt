Project settings --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Set "Project/Properties/Debugging/Debbuger Type" to "Mixed" - this will allow OutputDebugString to print to Output window in Visual Studio

- Boost is used only by Assimp libary. Should be removed together with Assimp.


Text Handling --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Based on http://www.utf8everywhere.org/

- std::strings and char* are considered UTF-8
- One character can take 1-4 bytes in memory
- All texts are stored in std::string
- std::string is not aware of the encoding of the underlying text
- Only use Win32 functions that accept widechars (LPWSTR), never those which accept LPTSTR or LPSTR. Pass parameters this way: SetWindowTextW( widen(someStdString).c_str() )

Notes:
UTF-16 is the worst encoding. Memory consuming and can still take 4 bytes to encode a single character. 
WinAPI uses wchar_t, which is UTF-16. That's the only option to use Unicode in Windows. That's why all UTF-8 texts need to be converted to UTF-16 before being passed to WinAPI.

 - Enable Whole Program Optimization

https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/0zza0de8.aspx

Whole program optimization allows the compiler to perform optimizations with information on all modules in the program. Without whole program optimization, optimizations are performed on a per module (compiland) basis.
Whole program optimization is off by default and must be explicitly enabled.
With information on all modules, the compiler can:
	* Optimize the use of registers across function boundaries.
	* Do a better job of tracking modifications to global data, allowing a reduction in the number of loads and stores.
	* Do a better job of tracking the possible set of items modified by a pointer dereference, reducing the numbers of loads and stores.
	* Inline a function in a module even when the function is defined in another module.


Files --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Never pass std::string or const char* filename arguments to the fstream family. MSVC CRT does not support UTF-8 arguments. Convert std::string arguments to std::wstring with widen: std::ifstream ifs( widen(someStdString), std::ios_base::binary);
- This code is not multi-platform and may have to be changed manually in the future.

Exceptions --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- all exceptions should have a message explaining the reason of failure
- this message should contain throwing class/method name ex: throw std::exception( "BlockMeshVertexShader::compileFromFile() - creating constant buffer failed" );
- message should end with a period.
- message can contain some information about the error in parentheses - indexes, names etc.

Comments --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- comments should be placed every two, three lines and at every block of code.
- the purpose of dense comments is to allow skimming through code quickly.
- comment format: // Some comment here.
- Space between the slash and the text. Uppercase letter first. Period at the end.
- methods should be commented. Info such as parameters, return values, exceptions thrown can be added to that comment.

Transformations --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- left-handed coordinate system (z-axis looks away)
- faces are defined clockwise

in C++ code:
- basis vectors are rows in matrix
- matrix memory layout is row-major
- order of transformations is from left to right - vertex * Matrix

passing matrices to HSLS shaders:
- when passing matrices from C++ to shaders their memory layout needs to be column-major (transposed), because we want to put each column in one constant regiter on GPU for faster matrix multiplication

in HLSL shader code:
- basis vectors are rows in matrix (as they were originally)
- order of transformations is from left to right - vertex * Matrix
- matrix layout is not programmer's concern
- #pragma pack_matrix(column_major) informs only about the memory layout of input matrices - not about how matrices are represented in code

loading models:
- 3D models are often in right-handed coordinate system
- they need to be converted to left-handed by:
1) inverting z-coordinate of vertices and normals
2) inverting texcoord v-component -> v = 1 - v
3) probably reordering vertices from anticlockwise to clockwise

Classes --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Keep classes small. Split into smaller classes as much as you can. Smaller classes are easier to manage, remove, move, refactor etc.
- Try to make classes use other classes at the same or lower level of abstraction - Mesh class can use math classes, but should't use AssetManager class. It's the role of AssetManager to use Mesh class.

Methods --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- When a method returns more than one value - use std::tuple to return them.

- Const methods which return references ( ex. const Mesh & getMesh() const ) should always return const-reference. Non-const versions of the same methods can be created to allow modification of the object.
- Methods which return objects can return non-const objects from const methods. We don't care if the returned object gets changed.

Ex.:

const Mesh & getMesh() const;
Mesh &		 getMesh();

- Don't place method definitions in the header files. 
- Don't use 'inline' keyword - it doesn't force the complier to inline anyways. Thanks to Whole Program Optimization methods will be inlined if needed.

Passing arguments -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Use std::shared_ptr to pass arguments to methods. If they don't store it, they will release the pointers quickly anyways.
- Store pointer as std::weak_ptr if instance is not an owner of an object - regardless whether arguments is std::shared_ptr or std::weak_ptr.
- Almost never pass smart pointers by reference (until extreme performance is needed). Reference to smart pointer won't stop object from being deleted.

Direct3D -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Use Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr<SomeDXClass> for storing Direct3D resources in class fields.

	This Smart Pointer increases internal DX reference count on creation and decreses it on destruction. DX pointers don't need to be passed using ComPtr as it would cause frequent increase/decrease in reference count.
	Instead, it's important that the final field which stores the resource is of type ComPtr.

	More info on how to use ComPtr in DX: http://directxtk.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=ComPtr

	- Generally, if you are creating a fresh ComPtr and then using a COM creation function or factory, you can use.GetAddressOf() since you know the ComPtr is initially null.

	ex.:
		Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr<ID3D11Device> device;
		D3D11CreateDevice( ..., device.GetAddressOf(), ... );

	- If you are using a ComPtr as a class member, then you should use .ReleaseAndGetAddressOf() to ensure any existing object reference is properly released. 
	The operator overload for & does the same thing as .ReleaseAndGetAddressOf(), but the explicit use of the method name is clearer in code.

	ex.:
		Microsoft::WRL::ComPtr<ID3D11Device> m_device;
		D3D11CreateDevice( ..., m_device.ReleaseAndGetAddressOf(), ... );
		is same as:
		D3D11CreateDevice( ..., &m_device, ... );

	- Because operator& maps to ReleaseAndGetAddressOf(), when calling DIrect3D 11 functions that take a pointer to an array of inputs 
	  and you are passing a single pointer, use the explicit .GetAddressOf() method instead:

	ex.:
		context->OMSetRenderTargets( 1, m_renderTargetView.GetAddressOf(),  m_depthStencilView.Get() );

	  If you use & operator the resource will be released and you don't want that:

	ex.:
		context->OMSetRenderTargets( 1, &m_renderTargetView,  m_depthStencilView.Get() );

		m_renderTargetView is released = NULL !

- When setting buffers for draw (IASetVertexBuffers) - use each buffer only once. If you need to get multiple values from a single buffer in a shader (interlaced values) - assign the same 'input slot' in 'input layout' for multiple inputs.
 'Input slot' in 'input layout' points to the buffer in which data is stored.

Enums -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Put enums which are related only to a single class inside of that class.
	Put enums which are related to two or more classes inside a separate file.

	Put enums inside a struct - to allow adding helper methods to it (I chose struct rather than namespace to have better coloring in IDE). 
	Use strongly-typed C==11 "enum class" instead of normal enums. Strongly-typed enums cannot be compared with each other without explicit cast.

	Example:

	.h file:

	struct BonesPerVertexCount
	{
		enum class Type : char
		{
			ZERO = 0,
			ONE = 1,
			TWO = 2,
			FOUR = 4
		};

		static const std::array<Type, 4> values;
	};

	.cpp file:

	const std::array<BonesPerVertexCount::Type, 4> BonesPerVertexCount::values = {
		BonesPerVertexCount::Type::ZERO, 
		BonesPerVertexCount::Type::ONE,
		BonesPerVertexCount::Type::TWO,
		BonesPerVertexCount::Type::FOUR
	};
