11.11.2015
	- test for loading meshes in AssetManager from the same path, but with different index in file
	- add test with textures, and textures and meshes mixed.
28.11.2015
	- add tests for loading asynchronously assets from inexisting paths. Mixed with correct paths. Should not crash AssetManager!
	- add tests for loading assets with sub-assets SYNCronously.
	- loading a model sync/async containing sub-assets which were already loaded. Should't throw exception.
