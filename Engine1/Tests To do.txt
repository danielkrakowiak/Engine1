06.03.2014
	- Add unit tests for Texture2D class
19.03.2014
	- Add tests to Texture2D for supported file format checks
	- Add tests to BlockMesh for supported file format checks
27.03.2014
	- Add test to check for loading the same mesh/texture multiple times - to check if collision is detected - both in sync and async mode
07.06.2014
	- Add a test for .obj file loading with mixed faces containing 3 and 4,5,6 vertices
	- Add test for .obj file loading with spaces at the end of the line or without spaces
29.09.2014
	- loading meshes from .obj files with inverted-Z-Asxis, fliped-UVs, fliped-vertex-winding-order
07.10.2014
	- add tests for loading assets to GPU
09.11.2014
	- add tests for SkeletonPose - adding/modifying/getting bones
10.11.2014
	- tests for all copyable classes to check whether copying is correct
	- parsing skeleton animation files
10.05.2015
	- tests for Texture2D, RenderTargeTexture2D, RenderTargetDepthTexture2D
06.11.2015
	- tests for loading/saving Texture2D file info, BlockMesh, SkeletonMesh file info, BlockModel, SkeletonModel from binary.
11.11.2015
	- test for loading meshes in AssetManager from the same path, but with different index in file
	- add test with textures, and textures and meshes mixed.
28.11.2015
	- add tests for loading asynchronously assets from inexisting paths. Mixed with correct paths. Should not crash AssetManager!
	- add tests for loading assets with sub-assets SYNCronously.
	- loading a model sync/async containing sub-assets which were already loaded. Should't throw exception.
06.12.2015
	- test whether an asset loaded with AssetManager has correct file info.


Tests should use PathManager to find assets. Or hardcoded paths.

Have some common function to set proper current-path for all tests.
