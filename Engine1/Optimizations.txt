Not useful:

- [Raytracing] Once we check that a mesh's bounding box max_dist and min_dsit along ray are all closer then rayLength there is no point checking it for every triangle... 
  Not useful because for shadow rays once we intersect any triangle it's probably the end of our work. So we calculate ray distance and run that check only once.
  For view rays it's also not useful because we calculate intersection distance because we need to know it the intersection occured closer then the previous one.
