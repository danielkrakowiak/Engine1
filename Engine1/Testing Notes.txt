When you get assertions from tests that normally run fine, 
check for hanging processes under Visual Studio (in Taks Manager). Kill them before running tests.
Look for vstest.executionengine.exe.

---------------------

To test x64 version of the code you need to change one setting: Menu->Test->Test Settings->Default Proessor Architecture->X64.

If Unit Test project crashes at startup it can be caused by incorrect project configuration and linking to missing libraries. 
Programs called "Dependacy Walker" or "ProcessMonitor" are useful for checking if UnitTest.dll or Engine.exe have such problems.

---------------------

If you get "Failed to setup execution context" error while running tests, 
it's probably caused by using a wrong version of .lib or .dll in Engine1 or UntiTest project (they should match).

Check for things such as Engine1 linking PhysX_x64.lib, while UnitTest linking PhysXCHECKED_x64.lib.
