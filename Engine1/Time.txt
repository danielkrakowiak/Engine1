Sun 16.11.2014 - 5h - Tried to fix exporting skeleton meshes to .dea in 3ds Max - seemed like not all the bones where exported. Installed OpenCollada exporter, but it made no difference. Reason seems to be in Assimp importer, which reads bones from joints only - last bones in chain are not loaded (their bind poses). Added bones ordering in per vertex data, so they were ordered by descending weight. Renamed SkeletonMesh to RiggedMesh. Added SkeletonBonePose class.
Thu 20.11.2014 - 4h - Modified SkeletonPose from a simple vector of poses to a proper class with methods to access bones. Implemented a feature - SkeletonPose recalculates bones pose in skeleton space when needed (user doesn't have to worry about that). Added SkeletonPose::combinePoses() method to combine two poses into one. (propbably not working correctly).
Sat 22.11.2014 - 4h - Added Bone inner class to SkeletonMesh - SkeletonMesh now stores all the information about skeleton structure.

Creating simple two-bone/two-boxes skeleton model for tests.
Tue 25.11.2014 - 4h - Found reason of incorrect skeleton rendering - final bone pose should be in it's own bind space, not in skeleton space (means that we are interested how far it moved from it's bind pose, not how far it moved from the skeleton origin). To fix this problem we need to multiply bone's pose in skeleton space by it's bind pose (or calculate it differently). Trying to fix the problem with soem vertices in the skeleton being exploded in some direction. Seems like some vertices aren't attached to any bones despite vertex-bone data presence in the buffer. Installed newest driver.
--- November 2014 - 35h
Sat 20.12.2014 - 1h - Found a workaround to incorrect skeleton rendering - setting vertex-bones buffer offset during rendering to -1.
Sun 21.12.2014 - 2h - Fixed skeleton rendering - reason: shader input layout for bones and weights had AlignedByteOffset property set to some value instead of 0. Info about stride is set during drawing, not in the input layout. 
Thu 25.12.2014 - 7h - Rewriting SkeletonPose to be independent from the space in which bones' poses are defined (to avoid confusion and complex code).

Fri 13.05.2016 - 9h - Added CombiningRenderer, CombiningVertexShader, CombiningFragmentShader - used to combine main image with reflections. Outputted surface position in world space from DeferredRenderer - to be used when spawning reflected/refracted rays. Changed RaytraceRenderer to use surface position instead of depth value to generate secondary rays. Switched back to storing normals with 3 components - it's impossible to calculate thrid component from the first two (unknown sign). Fixed all problems with reflections.
Sat 14.05.2016 - 7h - Added outputting hit position from raytracing shaders. Added copying main image to final render target without running any shaders. Added shading on the reflected image. Downloaded a 3d car model from internet and added UVs, textures to it.

Trying varius sampling schemes to improve blur quality, sampling mipmaps at different lods.
Sat 21.05.2016 - 7h - Thinking hard how to blur reflections efficently using gaussian blur, mipmaping, bilinear sampling and how to avoid color bleeding through eddges of objects in the reflection. Found a way to quickly blur any resolution mipmaps using 9-tap gaussian blur with only 4 samples (using bilinear filtering) to avoid visible aliasing - but aliasing is still visible when moving camera and colors still bleed thorugh object edges.

Fri 24.06.2016 - 4h - Created skybox meshes and models. Disabled generating secondary rays for surfaces with maximal roughness (to disable reflections on skybox). Debugged and fixed deadlock when loading many assets using AssetManager (parsing threads were all waiting for sub-assets to be parsed while no one was parsing). Fixed by parsing basic assets first (the ones without sub-assets).
Sat 25.06.2016 - 2h - Added selecting and moving/deleting light sources. Passed light sources to the shading shader using constant buffer.

Modifying dist-to-occluder calculations to store illumination-blur-radius instead.
Wed 07.12.2016 - 6h - Modified dist-to-occluder calculations to store illumination-blur-radius instead.

Decided to simulate soft shadows only inside the area of hard shadows (not spreading to the outside) - because of I couldn't spread info about blur radius properly outisde of hard shadows - there were gaps where soft and hard shadows intersected.

--- April 2017 - 30h
13.05.2017 - 1h - Improving relfections - simplifying hit-distance search significantly - no need to search samples on the other side of the screen - it's enough to just ensure nice edge transition through proper weighting of sky (far) samples. Added limiting FPS when window is not focused (to unload GPU and CPU).
14.05.2017 - 4h - Added two-way cast operators between float2/3 and int/2/3. Fixed debug sampling textures (by clicking on a pixel) which are smaller than screen. Refactored Application class a bit.

Such small values occur at pixels where reflected objects touches the reflective surface. Fixed rejecting off-screen samples when combining/blurring reflection image.
16.05.2017 - 6h - Removed halo around objects in reflection - caused by accepting wrong samples (reflected off different objects) and by blurring from mipmapping (so even center pixel was affected, when sampling higher mipmaps). Applied fixes from CombiningShader to CombiningShader2.

Added support for reload flag in textures, models - to mark if we want to realod them if they are already in GPU memory. Modified RenderTargetManager to create new RTs when needed. Also added methods to keep track of RT usage.
24.06.2017 - 1h - Refactoring Renderer to merge renderFirstReflections, renderFirstRefractions, renderReflections, renderRefractions into one method: renderSecondaryLayer.
25.06.2017 - 4h - Fixed a bug in combining shader for higher layers - it linearized prev-hit-distance (like depth) which was incorrect. Finished major refactoring of Renderer. Refactored RaytraceShadowRenderer, DistanceToOccluderSearchRenderer, BlurShadowsRenderer, ReflectionRefractionShadingRenderer to take render targets as inputs instead of using its own. Working on combining layers back to front (to fix hard edges in combined image).
28.06.2017 - 4h - Succeded at combining layers back to front. Modified reflection/refraction shading to not accumulate contribution/roughness over several layers - as it's not needed anymore. Refactored HitDistanceSearchRenderer to take render taregt as input. Fixed many issues with combining layers back to front.

--- August 2017 - 60h
21.10.2017 - 2h - Trying to split shadow into hard/soft part without light leaks.
25.10.2017 - 4h - Splitting shadow processing (ray tracing results storage, dist-to-occluder-search, shadow blurring), into 3 layers - for hard, medium, soft shadows. To avoid problems when hard and soft shadows intersect and overlap.
26.10.2017 - 4h - Splitting shadow processing into 3 layers. Added an option to set debug name for Render Target when acquiring it. Added new utility shader which sums up 3 values per pixel.
28.10.2017 - 2h - Splitting shadow processing into 3 layers. Testing on different scenes.
29.10.2017 - 7h - Refactoring/cleanup of shadow-blur shaders. Improving dist-to-occluder-search to give more smooth results, without jagged edges etc. Fixed a bug in mipmap-generation-with-sample-rejection shader - it was outputting negative values because of missing max(). This was causing jagged edges in dist-to-occluder mipmaps. Added radial weighting in dist-to-occluder-search shader - to improve blending of nearby regions (plus early rejecting samples without sampling the texture).
30.10.2017 - 2h
31.10.2017 - 4h - Added sampling different mipmaps during dist-to-occluder-search for hard/medium/soft shadows. It's better than skipping pixels, as it ensure smooth output image rather than undersampling artefacts and patterns. Added a setting to control final-dist-to-occluder texture diemnsions for hard/medium/soft shadows - important as it directly influences the number of executed shader threads (caching hides the benefits I guess). Fixed a bug in generate-mipmaps-with-sample-rejection shader, which was outputting zero if all samples were rejected instead of returning the original value - that caused background switch from white to black and increasing darkening of edges in dist-to-occluder mipmaps.
--- October 2017 - 25h
--- total 1338h
01.11.2017 - 10h - Added a separate setting for dist-to-occluder-search to control search-radius and search-step for pixels in shadow and in light (those which have a dist-to-occluder value and those which don't). This is supposed to reduce blur of distance values in regions of shadow - to avoid artifacts when object move close to each other etc. Fixed a problem with dist-to-occluder-search shader - it was sampling position/normal textures using integer coords, which caused problems when output dimensions stopped being the same as position texture dimensions. Fixed text rendering.
02.11.2017 - 6h - Cleaned up Profiler events, added missing ones etc. Disabled unnecessary shadow calculations when shadows are disabled. Fixed a problem when importing models that have no textures, but only texture color multipliers. Null texture was causing problems, so I added a default white texture used in such cases during import/parsing of models. Cleanup of TODO list.
05.11.2017 - 5h - Added settings in Control Panel to control position threshold in blur shadows shaders. Trying to remove light leaks at the transitions between shadow layers.
